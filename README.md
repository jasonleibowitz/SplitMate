# SplitMate



### Project Description

How often do you argue with your roommates when it comes to chores? One guy never takes the trash out, another never does the dishes, you always feel like you do everything. It's so frustrating! Not anymore. With SplitMate the only arguing happening in your apartment will be over who gets the last slice of pizza. 

SplitMate lets users track all chores in an apartment, follow who does what and even upvote or downvote their roommate if they don't adequately do a chore. Users can gain points by doing chores. If you fail to do a chore by its due date, you have to pay up. The next person to do that chore gets the money you forfeit by being a lazy bum. 

This project was built by the following team members during [General Assembly](https://generalassemb.ly/)'s [Web Development Immersive](https://generalassemb.ly/education/web-development-immersive) as our second project.
